# How to Contribute

We're so thankful you're considering contributing to an [open source project of the U.S. government](https://code.gov/)! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- 
or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its
[LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

### Writing Issues

If you would like to comment on the Living HHS Open Data Plan, please let us know by filing an **[issue on our GitHub repository](https://hhs.github.io/lodp-ux/).**

### Writing Pull Requests

Comments should be formatted to a width no greater than 80 columns.

Files should be exempt of trailing spaces.

We adhere to a specific format for commit messages. Please write your commit
messages along these guidelines. Please keep the line width no greater than 80
columns (You can use `fmt -n -p -w 80` to accomplish this).

    module-name: One line description of your change (less than 72 characters)

    Problem

    Explain the context and why you're making that change.  What is the problem
    you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be
    thought of being the motivation for your change.

    Solution

    Describe the modifications you've done.

    Result

    What will change as a result of your pull request? Note that sometimes this
    section is unnecessary because it is self-explanatory based on the solution.

Some important notes regarding the summary line:

- Describe what was done; not the result
- Use the active voice
- Use the present tense
- Capitalize properly
- Do not end in a period â€” this is a title/subject
- Prefix the subject with its scope

## Reviewing Pull Requests

Pull requests will be reviewed by the Living HHS Open Data Plan team.
